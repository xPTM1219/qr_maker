# Contributing to QRMaker

If you would like to add to the project you are welcome.
Just follow this guide and you good to go.
Whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Github usage

I'll be using Github to host the code, track issues and feature requests,
releases, as well as pull requests.

## Pull requests

When submitting a pull request, I'll take a look at it and whether
approve it or not. Of course, give a good description of what you are adding
and comment the code including Python docstring. Update the `plans.md` to
keep track of what to do next. Don't worry about the history because
the code is now on Github. Remember to update the version number in the code.

## Issues

Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/xptm1219/qr_maker/issues)

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug
report from `briandk`.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if needed
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff
  you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Since I work with linters almost daily, I know a lot of rules by head, meaning
I can possibly have some errors in the linting, but please use the following
tools depending on the language:

- For Markdown files I use `makdownlint`
- For Python I use `pylint`
